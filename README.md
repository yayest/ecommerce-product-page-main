## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The first time I did gallery and lightbox gallery. I probably messed up with js, because I still don't know it very well.

### Continued development

I think we need to focus more on js in the next projects.
